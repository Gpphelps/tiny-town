# Tiny Town

## Description
Tiny Town is a web application that allows users to build and name neighborhoods that are placed in a city with the neighborhoods of other users. Neighborhood locations are restricted to areas directly adjacent to neighborhoods that have already been created. There are currently 5 types of structures that users can place in their neighborhood: roads, commercial buildings, business buildings, residential buildings, and parks. Users can also demolish any of the structures they would like to before they save their neighborhood. Users can also select the color that they want their building to be before they place it or they can select the option to have their buildings be a random color when placed. In order for a plot to be placed in the city there must be a road running from each side of the neighborhood to the other side in order for the city to connect to itself.

Once the user has their neighborhood they way that they want it they can hit the save neighborhood button and they are redirected to the homepage where their new neighborhood is waiting for them to explore. 

When the user is done creating, or they need to leave the app they can logout from Tiny Town with our dedicated logout page, but they can still enjoy viewing the city from the homepage.
